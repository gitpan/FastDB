Query data of a FastDB database. Synopsis:

Show version
        db_question.pl --version  (or -v --ver   etc ...)
This help screen
        db_question.pl --help     (or -h --help  etc ...)
How to load data
        db_question.pl [--config $ConfigFile]
Examples
        db_question.pl
        db_question.pl -v
        db_question.pl --input c:\Load\log\daily.csv
        db_question.pl --config /etc/load.cfg  --input /opt/AppF/data


--config is optional. It is the path of the delete configuration
file. If it is missing, program search for a file called
db_delete.conf  at the same directory it resides.

At the configuration file write the filters and conditions
for the returned data. Also you define what to do the found data.

Every filter is applied only to its column
Conditions applied to all columns.
Filtees are much faster than conditions because.
Do not use conditions if you can narrow your selection with Filters.
