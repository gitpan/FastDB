Load data to FastDB database. Syntax:

Show version
        db_load.pl --version  (or -v --ver   etc ...)
This help screen
        db_load.pl --help     (or -h --help  etc ...)
How to load data
        db_load.pl [--input $DataFile] [--config $ConfigFile]
Examples
        db_load.pl
        db_load.pl -v
        db_load.pl --input c:\Load\log\daily.csv
        db_load.pl --config /etc/load.cfg  --input /opt/AppF/data

--input is optional.  It is the path of your input data file you
want to load at the database. If it is missing, program search for
a file called  data.csv  at the same directory it resides.

--config is optional. It is the path of the loading configuration
file. If it is missing, program search for a file called
db_load.conf  at the same directory it resides.

At load time you can have extra columns. Define them at your configuration
file at "Extra virtual columns"  Their values are  calculated dynamic at execution time. These are:

	EXTRA_DAY          DD              01   - 31
	EXTRA_MONTH        MM              01   - 12
	EXTRA_YEAR         YYYY            1970 - 3517
	EXTRA_HOUR         hh              00   - 23
	EXTRA_MINUTE       mm              00   - 59
	EXTRA_SECOND       ss              00   - 59
	EXTRA_TIMESTAMP    YYYYMMDDhhmmss  20101201123957

Configuration file settings

Columns with indexes     : define the columns you want to index
Extra virtual columns    : Which extra columns you want to use
Do not load these fields : which columns you want to not load their data. Leave it blank to load all columns

There is implemented de-duplication technology. That means the index names
are removed from the fields that are written at db.
