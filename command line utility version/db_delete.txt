How to load data
        db_delete.pl [--config $ConfigFile]
Examples
        db_delete.pl
        db_delete.pl -v
        db_delete.pl --input c:\Load\log\daily.csv
        db_delete.pl --config /etc/load.cfg  --input /opt/AppF/data


--config is optional. It is the path of the delete configuration
file. If it is missing, program search for a file called
db_delete.conf  at the same directory it resides.

At the configuration file write the filters for data deletion.
All filters must be TRUE to delete a row
