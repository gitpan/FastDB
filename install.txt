FastDB is working as is to ALL operating systems with Perl 5.1 or greater.

There is a case to have problem at windows when you have multiple
indexes with very long values because of the 255 characters NTFS max path
limitation.

It is recommented to use a linux partition (or mounted file) formatted
with btrfs file system

Because this module is implemented with pure Perl it is enough to copy
FastDB directory somewhere at your @INC . For your convenient you can use
the following commands to install/uninstall the module

Install:     setup_module.pl --install   --module=FastDB
Uninstall:   setup_module.pl --uninstall --module=FastDB
  
Or you can manual copy FastDB directory where your script is.
To produce updated documentation files issue the commands

pod2html --infile=./FastDB/Load.pm --outfile=FastDB-Load.html
pod2text          ./FastDB/Load.pm     "how to load data.txt"

pod2html --infile=./FastDB/Delete.pm --outfile=FastDB-Delete.html
pod2text          ./FastDB/Delete.pm     "how to delete data.txt"

pod2html --infile=./FastDB/Question.pm --outfile=FastDB-Question.html
pod2text          ./FastDB/Question.pm     "how to ask questions.txt"
